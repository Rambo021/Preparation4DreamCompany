# System Design

## API for booking rooms
> You're given an external system which can tell you whether there are available rooms at a hotel. Multiple hotel booking services like Booking, Expedia, etc are all using this service to book hotels. How would you handle the problem of making sure a hotel room is booked.
There was a lot of discussion about handling different type of cases, how the hotel booking services will update the external service when they've booked a room, collision cases, and how to make this design extensible.
