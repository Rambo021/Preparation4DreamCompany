2. Can you tell me briefly about your current role and responsibilities at Shanghai Zhongtong BlueNet？

   > 当然，在这个公司里我是一个Tech Lead，带领一个小型团队负责一个电商平台的开发和维护，我们曾在3个月内完成了这个电商系统的从0到1的开发和上线；现在这个电商系统进入了维护阶段，我又开始负责公司核心系统的功能重构，这是一个复杂且困难的工作，不过在AI的辅助下，我顺利完成了前期的方案设计和系统设计。
   >
   > Of course. In my current role, I'm a Tech Lead in the company. I'm leading a small team responsible for developing and maintaining an e-commerce platform. We successfully built and launched this system from scratch in just three months, which was quite an achievement.
   >

3. Can you tell me more about how you've used AI in your current role, particularly in the refactoring project? What specific benefits or improvements have you seen from incorporating AI into your development process?

   > 是的，AI很大程度上提升了工作效率，并且在问题分析、系统设计和编码上提供了很多有效的帮助。 比如这次的系统重构，我先写好了一份文档，包含 当前遇到的问题、需要达成的目标以及初步的解决方案，将它上传给AI，提示它对文档进行分析并提出改进意见；AI给出了非常有用的意见，我依据这些意见对解决方案进行修改再次上传给AI进行分析；如此往复几次，就得到了适合的最终解决方案。 再比如平时的编码中，如果忘记了具体的语法或者希望快速完成某个函数或功能的实现，可以将问题描述给AI，提示它给出代码实现。
   >
   > Absolutely. AI has significantly boosted our productivity and provided valuable assistance in problem analysis **/əˈnæləsɪs/**, system design, and coding.
   >
   > For instance, in our recent system refactoring project, I started by drafting a document outlining the current issues, our objectives, and initial solution proposals. I then fed this document into an AI system, prompting it to analyze**/ˈænəlaɪz/** and suggest improvements. The AI provided incredibly**/ɪnˈkredəbli/** useful feedback, which I used to refine our solutions. This back-and-forth helped us arrive at a highly optimized final solution.
   >
   > In day-to-day coding, AI has been a great tool as well. If I'm stuck on a particular syntax**/ˈsɪntæks/** or need to quickly implement a specific function or feature, I can describe the problem to the AI and ask it to generate code. This has been a real time-saver and has helped maintain coding efficiency.
   >
   > Overall, integrating AI into our development process has enhanced our problem-solving capabilities, sped up our workflow, and improved the quality of our solutions. 

4. Given your experience as a Tech Lead, can you tell me about a challenging situation you faced while managing a team or a project? How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?

   > 这是个很棒的问题，作为一个Tech Lead，不仅需要在技术上给团队以指导和帮助，在项目进度的管理上还需要与跨团队的同事进行合作。 在中通做电商系统的时候就遇到过一个比较挑战的问题：我给组员分配了一个任务需要他和其他团队的开发人员进行合作，当时评估了5天的工作时间；在第3天的时候我询问他这个任务的进度时，他告诉我进度很慢，原因是其他团队的人员说他很忙没有足够的时候来进行合作；这个问题比较重要，如果不能按时完成将会影响整个项目的进度，于是我将这个任务挪到了我的名下，并给组员分配了一个新的任务；然后我预定了一个会议邀请了产品经理、开发经理和相关的开发人员，讲述了当前遇到的问题并提出了需要的帮助，最终在产品经理和开发经理的协助下，我们顺利完成了这个任务的合作。
   >
   > That's a greate question. As a Tech Lead, my role involves not just providing technical guidance to the team, but also managing project progress and collaborating with other teams.
   >
   > I faced a particularly challenging situation during the e-commerce project at Zhongtong. I had assigned a task to one of my team members that required collaboration with developers from another team. We initially estimated it would take about 5 days.
   >
   > On the third day, when I checked in on the progress, I learned that things were moving much slower than expected**/ɪkˈspektɪd/**. The reason was that the developers from the other team complained they were too busy to collaborate effectively. This was a critical task, and any delay would impact the entire project timeline.
   >
   > To address this, I took immediate action. First, I reassigned the task to myself and gave my team member a different task to work on. Then, I scheduled a meeting with the product manager, and the relevant developers. In this meeting, I explained the situation we were facing and outlined the support we needed.
   >
   > Thanks to the assistance of the product managers, we were able to prioritize**/praɪˈɔːrətaɪz/** this collaboration and successfully complete the task. This experience not only reinforced**/ˌriːɪnˈfɔːrst/** the importance of proactive communication, but also taught me the value of being flexible and ready to step in personally when needed to keep the project on track. 
   >

5. 为什么在连连只做了半年？

   > 这是一个面试中常被问到的问题。主要原因是当时我计划在杭州定居，所以我先过去了。然而，我的女朋友在杭州没有找到合适的工作，加上我的父母都在上海，他们希望我回到上海，所以我决定回去。
   > This is a common question in my interviews. The main reason was that we had initially planned to settle down in Hangzhou, so I moved there first. However, my girlfriend couldn’t find a suitable job in the city, and with my parents being in Shanghai, they also preferred that I return. So, I made the decision to move back to Shanghai.

8. 为什么离开Coupang？

   > I decided to leave Coupang for a couple of reasons. 
   >
   > Primarily, I felt my work there had become less challenging over time, and I was eager**/ ˈiːɡər /** to find a new platform where I could take on more complex and stimulating**/ ˈstɪmjuleɪtɪŋ /** projects. I've always been motivated by pushing my skills to the next level, and I felt it was time for a new challenge.
   >
   > Additionally, there were some organizational changes after our director left. And there was a situation where I was offered a performance improvement plan, which I didn't feel was necessary or beneficial for my career growth at that time. After careful consideration, I decided it was best to seek opportunities elsewhere that allowed me to fully utilize**/ ˈjuːtəlaɪz /** and expand my skillset.
